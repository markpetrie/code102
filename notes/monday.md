Git simple workflow.. You first make changes to one or more files in a local directory
Next, you need to use git add to ADD those changes to a staging area
Next, you need to use git commit to commit some or all of the changes in the staging area to the local git repository
Finally, you use git push to push the committed changes in the local repository to another repository, likely master
